# Active Intents Specification
# 
# This file defines the business requirements and features currently being worked on.
# Each intent represents a formalized specification with scope, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
#
# The AI agent MUST select an active intent before modifying files using the select_active_intent tool.
# This ensures proper context loading, scope validation, and traceability.
